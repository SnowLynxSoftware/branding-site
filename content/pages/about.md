The idea of Snowlynx Software was originally created by me, Dylan Legendre, around 2014. At the time, that’s all it was–an idea. Any time I started on a new hobby project or idea it was under the name of Snowlynx Software. None of those projects ever came to fruition or seen actual daylight. Fast forward to October 2023 when I started working on something I really enjoyed, I created this website as a means to showcase all of my projects and get the word out!

I am dedicated to providing awesome code and delivering jaw dropping solutions. This isn’t just a job, but a passion. I want to make my mark but leaving the world just a little better than when I found it through the creative engineering of video games, web apps, and other fun things that I can do with my skills. So join me in my quest and enjoy the journey!
