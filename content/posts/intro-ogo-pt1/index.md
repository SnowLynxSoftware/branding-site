## Announcing: Open Galaxies Online!

Open Galaxies Online will be an open sourced, free-to-play, and persistent browser-based game (PBBG) in the genre of Sci-Fi 4X Strategy. The game is still in it's
very early design stages, but by making an announcement--it's real! The game will be completely open sourced (GPLv3) and available on Github. We want the community to be the driving force behind the development team's priorities as well as having visibility into the codebase. This offers not only transparency into how the game works or data is being used--but also offers itself as a learning tool for other inspired developers to learn from our mistakes (or from our hopeful successes!).

I will be posting links to the repositories on Github once I have them all available with some boilerplate and basic README things.
