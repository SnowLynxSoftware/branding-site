## Announcing: Open Trivia Online!

[Open Trivia Online](https://opentriviaonline.com/) will be a free to play and open source trivia game played online. You will be able to compete in leaderboards based on categories. You can challenge other players, compete in tournaments, host private games with multiple players, and more. Additionally I will allow players to upload their own custom trivia decks (to be approved through moderation). The game is still in its infancy at the moment.

We want the community to be the driving force behind the development team's priorities as well as having visibility into the codebase. This offers not only transparency into how the game works or data is being used--but also offers itself as a learning tool for other inspired developers to learn from our mistakes (or from our successes!).

You can follow along with development by following us on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/SnowLynxSoftware/repositories)

**My Current Tech Stack:**

- Golang Backend API
- Angular Frontend Client WEB
- Postgres DB
