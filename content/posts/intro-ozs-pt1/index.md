## Announcing: OpenZooSim!

OpenZooSim will be an open source, free-to-play, and persistent browser-based game (PBBG) in the genre of Simulation/Strategy. The game is still in it's
very early design stages, but by making an announcement--it's real! The game will be completely open sourced (GPLv3) and available on Github. We want the 
community to be the driving force behind the development team's priorities as well as having visibility into the codebase. This offers not only 
transparency into how the game works or data is being used--but also offers itself as a learning tool for other inspired developers to learn from 
our mistakes (or from our successes!).

I will be posting links to the repositories on Github once I have them all available with some boilerplate and basic README things.
