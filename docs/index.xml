      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;announcing-open-trivia-online&#34;&gt;Announcing: Open Trivia Online!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://opentriviaonline.com/&#34;&gt;Open Trivia Online&lt;/a&gt; will be a free to play and open source trivia game played online. You will be able to compete in leaderboards based on categories. You can challenge other players, compete in tournaments, host private games with multiple players, and more. Additionally I will allow players to upload their own custom trivia decks (to be approved through moderation). The game is still in its infancy at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of Snowlynx Software was originally created by me, Dylan Legendre, around 2014. At the time, that’s all it was–an idea. Any time I started on a new hobby project or idea it was under the name of Snowlynx Software. None of those projects ever came to fruition or seen actual daylight. Fast forward to October 2023 when I started working on something I really enjoyed, I created this website as a means to showcase all of my projects and get the word out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
