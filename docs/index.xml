      <description>Announcing: OpenZooSim! OpenZooSim will be an open source, free-to-play, and persistent browser-based game (PBBG) in the genre of Simulation/Strategy. The game is still in it&amp;rsquo;s very early design stages, but by making an announcement&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s real! The game will be completely open sourced (GPLv3) and available on Github. We want the community to be the driving force behind the development team&amp;rsquo;s priorities as well as having visibility into the codebase. This offers not only transparency into how the game works or data is being used&amp;ndash;but also offers itself as a learning tool for other inspired developers to learn from our mistakes (or from our successes!</description>

      <description>The idea of Snowlynx Software was originally created by me, Dylan Legendre, around 2014. At the time, that’s all it was–an idea. Any time I started on a new hobby project or idea it was under the name of Snowlynx Software. None of those projects ever came to fruition or seen actual daylight. Fast forward to October 2023 when I started working on something I really enjoyed, I created this website as a means to showcase all of my projects and get the word out!</description>
