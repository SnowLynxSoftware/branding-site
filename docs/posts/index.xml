      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;announcing-open-trivia-online&#34;&gt;Announcing: Open Trivia Online!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://opentriviaonline.com/&#34;&gt;Open Trivia Online&lt;/a&gt; will be a free to play and open source trivia game played online. You will be able to compete in leaderboards based on categories. You can challenge other players, compete in tournaments, host private games with multiple players, and more. Additionally I will allow players to upload their own custom trivia decks (to be approved through moderation). The game is still in its infancy at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
