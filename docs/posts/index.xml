      <description>Announcing: Open Galaxies Online! Open Galaxies Online will be an open sourced, free-to-play, and persistent browser-based game (PBBG) in the genre of Sci-Fi 4X Strategy. The game is still in it&amp;rsquo;s very early design stages, but by making an announcement&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s real! The game will be completely open sourced (GPLv3) and available on Github. We want the community to be the driving force behind the development team&amp;rsquo;s priorities as well as having visibility into the codebase.</description>
